# 0x15. C - Simple Shell <br />

Year 1 - Low-level programming & Algorithm ― Linux and Unix system programming - Holberton School
### Team:
[Zac Woll](https://github.com/zacwoll)
[Tabitha O'Melay](https://github.com/tabbykatz)

## Compilation
Our shell is compiled this way: <br />
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic simple_shell.c simple_helpers.c pathfinder.c built_ins.c -o sh` <br />
`./sh`

## Commands
### At minimum, this shell handles the following commands to display file contents on the command line:
`cat`: Concatenates the file and gives output on standard output. <br />
`less`: View files instead of opening the file. Allows backward and forward movement. <br />
`more`: Page through text one screenful at a time. <br />
### This shell handles the following file and directory manipulation commands:
`mkdir`: Creates a directory and accepts directory name as next parameter. <br />
`rm` and `rm -r`: Used to delete files and directories. <br />
`touch`: Creates a file or updates a file. <br />

### And the following basic command line navigation commands:

`ls`: Displays list of all files and folders in the current directory. <br />
`cd`: Changes the directory. <br />
`du`: Shows disk usage. <br />
`pwd`: Shows the present working directory. <br />
`man` + `cmd`: Shows the manual entry for any given command. <br />
`exit`: Quits the simple_shell program.

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
- Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
- Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
- Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
- Who is Ken Thompson
- How does a shell work
- What is a pid and a ppid
- How to manipulate the environment of the current process
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
- How to create processes
- What are the three prototypes of main
- How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
- How to execute another program with the execve system call
- How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
- What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

# Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to (why?)

# More Info

## Output
- Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
- The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)

Example of error with sh: <br />

Example of same error with our program hsh: <br />
